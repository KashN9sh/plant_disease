# 🌱✨ Plant Disease Recognition with AI

## Welcome to our Green Oasis! 🌿🚀

Greetings, plant enthusiasts! 🌺 Here in our magical garden, we've cultivated a project that combines the wonders of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the art of tending to our leafy friends. Join us on this journey as we empower farmers and gardeners alike to identify and conquer plant diseases, ensuring our crops flourish and our gardens bloom with happiness! 🌳💖

## Features 🌟

- **Disease Classification:** Meet our AI plant health superhero! It's trained to spot various diseases in plants based on images.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Our project boasts a user interface so friendly, even plants would give it a thumbs up! 👍🌿
- **Fast and Accurate:** Lightning-fast and as accurate as a keen-eyed botanist – that's our underlying AI model for you! ⚡🔍

## Get Started 🚀

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KashN9sh/plant_disease.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Greenhouse:**
   ```bash
   cd plant_disease
   ```

3. **Build and Run the Magic Stack:**
   ```bash
   .bin/dev up --build
   ```

4. **Cultivate the React Frontend:**
   ```bash
   .bin/dev exec front bash
   ```

   ```bash
   cd plant
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

   Open your web browser and go to:
   - Web UI: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - Swagger API Documentation: [http://localhost:5000/api/docs](http://localhost:5000/api/docs)

   Experience the enchantment on port 3000 for the web UI!

## How to Blossom 🌺

1. **Upload Image:**
   - Navigate to the web interface.
   - Upload an image of a plant leaf or affected area.

2. **Harvest Results:**
   - The AI model will work its enchantment on the image and provide a classification of the detected plant disease.
   - View the results on the web interface – it's like discovering the secrets of the plant world! 🌟🌿

## Growth Journey 🎯

### Short-term Goals

- [ ] Enhance the accuracy of disease classification.
- [x] Sprinkle some magic on the user interface for an even better experience.
- [ ] Conduct additional testing on a variety of plant species.

### Medium-term Goals

- [ ] Explore the possibility of real-time disease detection in the field – like having a plant health sidekick!
- [ ] Implement a feedback system for users to report misclassifications – teamwork makes the dream work! 💪🌱
- [ ] Optimize the model for deployment on magical edge devices.

### Long-term Goals

- [ ] Collaborate with magical agricultural experts to expand the dataset and improve model robustness.
- [ ] Develop a mobile application for on-the-go disease identification – because plants deserve superheroes on the move too!
- [ ] Investigate the integration of other technologies, such as IoT, for a comprehensive plant health orchestra.
