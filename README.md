# Plant Disease Recognition with AI 🌱✨

## Overview

Welcome to our plant disease recognition project! 🌿 Harnessing the magic of Artificial Intelligence (AI), we aim to empower farmers and gardeners with the ability to identify and classify diseases in plants. Let's join hands to ensure healthier crops and happier gardens! 🌺🚀

## Features

- **Disease Classification:** The AI model is like a plant health superhero, trained to recognize various diseases based on input images.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Our project boasts a user interface so friendly, even plants would give it a thumbs up! 👍🌿
- **Fast and Accurate:** Lightning-fast and as accurate as a keen-eyed botanist – that's our underlying AI model for you! ⚡🔍

## Installation with Docker Compose

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/plant-disease-recognition.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd plant-disease-recognition
   ```

3. **Build and Run the Docker Compose Stack:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   Open your web browser and go to:
   - Web UI: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Swagger API Documentation: `http://localhost:5000/app/docs`

   Experience the magic on port 3000 for the web UI!

## Usage

1. **Upload Image:**
   - Navigate to the web interface.
   - Upload an image of a plant leaf or affected area.

2. **Get Results:**
   - The AI model will work its enchantment on the image and provide a classification of the detected plant disease.
   - View the results on the web interface – it's like discovering the secrets of the plant world! 🌟🌿

## Roadmap 🚀

### Short-term Goals

- [ ] Improve the accuracy of disease classification.
- [x] Sprinkle some magic on the user interface for an even better experience.
- [ ] Conduct additional testing on a variety of plant species.

### Medium-term Goals

- [ ] Explore the possibility of real-time disease detection in the field – like having a plant health sidekick!
- [ ] Implement a feedback system for users to report misclassifications – teamwork makes the dream work! 💪🌱
- [ ] Optimize the model for deployment on magical edge devices.

### Long-term Goals

- [ ] Collaborate with magical agricultural experts to expand the dataset and improve model robustness.
- [ ] Develop a mobile application for on-the-go disease identification – because plants deserve superheroes on the move too!
- [ ] Investigate the integration of other technologies, such as IoT, for a comprehensive plant health orchestra.
